# Malaria-Classification-and-Prediction-using-Resnet-Architecture
In this project, I have used the NIH dataset containing Parasitized and Uninfected images of malaria disease. I used Resnet architecture to do the classification and predicted the category of images the model had never seen before.
The code has been taken from PyImageSearch Blog. We got around 96% training and validation accuracy. The final prediction has also been saved to a csv file for easier understanding. Google Colab has been used to write the entire notebook.
